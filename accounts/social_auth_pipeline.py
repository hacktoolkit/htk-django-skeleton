# backend - current social authentication backend (`backend.name`)
# uid - given by authentication provider
# details - user details given by authentication provider
# user - already logged in user or newly created user
# is_new - if `user` is newly created

# 1. If there is no email, have the user enter an email
# 2. Check association. If there is an account with that email:
#    a. "An account with this email address already exists. Please log in to link your {{ SOCIAL }} account."
#    b. "An account with this email address is already linked to {{ SOCIAL }}. Please create a new account using a different email address."
# 3. Create the account with the username and email
